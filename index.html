    <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
    <h2>The Five Pillars of Data Visualization</h2>
    <div><p>Alberto Cairo has graciously transmitted the 5 integral laws that dictate what a good data visualization must do. He is not the 
      originator of these necessary qualities and attributes them to the enlightened Enrico Bertini. For a data visualization to be
      orthodox, it must adhere to the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>It is truthful,</strong> as it's based on thorough and honest research.
      <li><strong>It is functional,</strong> as it constitutes an accurate depiction of the data, and it's built in a way that lets people
        do meaningful operations based on it.</li>
      <li><strong>It is beautiful,</strong> in the sense of being attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended
        audience.</li>
      <li><strong>It is insightful,</strong> as it reveals evidence that we would have a hard time seeing otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>It is enlightening</strong> because if we grasp and accept the evidence it depicts, it will change our minds for the
        better.</li>
    </ol></div>

    <h2>The Enlightening</h2>
    <p>The above infographic shows the percentage of U.S. population by age group. It gracefully displays three axes with a series of
      two dimentional images. Instead of haveing the z-axis depicted in one image, the artist made the sensible decesion of using time
      passing to display, you guessed it, time passing. With the clean presentation, one's mind is open to inquire about the implications
      and causes of the data. Why did the baby boom happen? Why do females an average outlive males? Why didn't the baby boom lead to 
      a subsequent baby boom from the babies boomed?It thoroughly expands the island of knowledge and doesn't create a confusing fog 
      that obfuscates the known and how to reach the unknown.</p>

    <h2>The Frightening</h2>
    <p>This graphic that portrays information is supposed to show what baby boomers say about themselves but the format was quite poorly 
      thought out. The dude in which the data is supposed to be volumized is apparently 2.43 humans as he contains 243% percentage points.
      I'm quite dissapointed the artist didn't add several extra heads and extremities as a means to contain the full data set. I assume
      that the boomers enquired were allowed to state more than one attribute about themselves. Also, the volumes on the dude aren't
      very proprotional to the percentages they represent. Note how people savvy is roughly the same size as willing to learn despite the 
      difference in percentage points. The island of knowledge is kind of expanded with the realization that boomers seem to think quite
      highly of themselves but the graphic part of the infographic does nothing to help this. A suggestion as a way to display the data
      would be arranging the statements into voice bubbles and making the percentage proportional to the bubble's volume.</p>
